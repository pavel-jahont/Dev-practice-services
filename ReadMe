This repository contains three services:
1) A service that generates three random integers X, Y and Z. If X is greater than Z, then display the sum of X and Y through logging in DEBUG mode, otherwise the value Z.
Display the arithmetic mean of these numbers through logging in INFO mode.

2) A service that generates an array of random integers whose magnitude does not exceed 300 (-300 ... 300). The number of elements in the array is 10.
Find the maximum and minimum numbers in the array and display. Replace the maximum element with the minimum, multiplied by the maximum.
Display the resulting array in ERROR mode.

3) A service that generates 10 objects of the Car class with the characteristics name (String), carModel (Enum with three value objects), engine小apacity (int in the range 1-3).
Groups them by engine小apacity using Map. For an arbitrary value, engine小apacity writes to the file the corresponding list of objects in the format: <name>: <carMode>: engine小apacity
